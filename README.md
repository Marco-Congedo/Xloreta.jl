# Xloreta

This is a pure-[julia](https://julialang.org/) 100%-human package for computing, testing and using human EEG 
(Electroencephalography) inverse solutions of the *Minimum Norm* family. Particularly, it implements the following vector-type distributed inverse solutions:
- *weighted minimum norm* — see [^1] for a review,
- *standardized Low-Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography* (sLORETA) [^2],
- *exact Low-Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography* (eLORETA) [^3].

For all of them, the usual *model-driven* and the *data-driven* [^4] versions are provided, with the latter being actually *beamformers* like in [^5] [^6] [^7] and being little known in the current literature.

## 🔣 Problem Statement, Notation and Nomenclature

We are given an EEG sensor potentials measurement

𝐱(𝑡) ∈ ℝⁿ 

at n electrodes referenced to the common average, in μV units, where 𝑡 is discrete time (samples);

we wish to estimate the current density

𝐣(𝑡) ∈ ℝᵖ 

at p cortical grey matter voxels, in A/m² units, in the three Cartesian spatial directions (x, y, z).

We have therefore:

**Forward equation** — determining the scalp voltage given the current distribution:

𝐱(𝑡) = 𝐊 𝐣(𝑡).

It is unique for a given leadfield matrix 

𝐊 ∈ ℝⁿ×³ᵖ.

Each column of the leadfield is the scalp field for unit-length dipole pointing in one of three orthogonal directions. The leadfield encapsulates a physical head model [^9] [^10].

**Inverse solution** — estimating the current distribution given the scalp voltage:

𝐣(𝑡) = 𝐓 𝐱(𝑡).

It is not unique. Each inverse solution method yields a different transfer matrix

𝐓 ∈ ℝ³ᵖ×ⁿ,

the computation of which is the main purpose of this package. For details on the composition of the 𝐊 and 𝐓 matrices the see [^8].

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> A solution is said *genuine* or to *respect the measurement* if 
> 𝐊 𝐓 = 𝐈.
> The weighted minimum norm and eLORETA are genuine solutions, while sLORETA is not.
>
> Also, matrix 
> 𝐓 𝐊 ≠ 𝐈 
> is called the resolution matrix [^11]. Its successive groups of three columns, one group per voxel, are called the point-spread functions. 
> They allow to ascertain whether the transfer matrix is capable of correctly localizing a single current dipole, regardless of its position (voxel) and orientation.
>
> This is a minimal localization capability for an inverse solution, as it (unrealistically) assumes the absence of noise in the measurement and the existence of only one active dipole at a time. Nonetheless, it is a minimal requirement. sLORETA and eLORETA possess this property, while the minimum norm does not, like most inverse solution methods found in the literature.

> [!TIP] 
> Overall, eLORETA is known to be an excellent choice, as it provides stable results without requiring fine-tuned noise level estimation [^12].

> [!WARNING] 
> Throughout this documentation and in the package it is always assumed both the input data and the leadfield matrix are referenced to the common average — see [centeringMatrix](#centeringmatrix).

### centeringMatrix

```julia
function centeringMatrix(N::Int)
```
The common average reference (CAR) operator for referencing EEG data potentials so that their mean across sensors (space) is zero at all samples.

Let 𝐗 be the s × n EEG recording, where s and n denote the number of samples and channels (sensors), respectively, and let 𝐇ₙ be the n×n centering matrix, then

𝐘 = 𝐗 𝐇ₙ

is the CAR (or centered) data.

𝐇ₙ is named the common average reference operator. It is given by 

𝐇ₙ = 𝐈ₙ − (1/n) (𝟭ₙ 𝟭ₙᵀ),

where 𝐈ₙ is the n-dimensional identity matrix and 𝟭ₙ is the n-dimensional vector of ones — see for example p.67 in [^13].

Alias ℌ (U+210C, with escape sequence "frakH")

Return the n×n centering matrix.

### minNorm

```julia
function minNorm(K::Matrix{R},
                 α::Real=0.,
                 C::Union{Symbol, Symmetric{R}, Hermitian{R}}=:modelDriven;
                 W::Union{Vector{R}, Nothing}=nothing) where R<:Real
```

Given a n × 3p leadfield matrix, where n is the number of electrodes and 3p is the number of p voxels times 3 (the x, y, z source components),
return the **minimum norm regularized transfer matrix** with regularization `α`.

if `C` is `:modelDriven` (default), compute the model driven solution, otherwise `C` must be the data covariance matrix and in this case compute the
data-driven solution — see [here](https://github.com/Marco-Congedo/Loreta.jl/blob/master/Documents/Overview.pdf). If `C` is a matrix, it must be flagged as `Symmetric` or as `Hermitian`  — see the 💡 [examples](#-examples).

if optional keyword argument `W` is a vector of 3p non-negative weights, compute the **weighted minimum norm solution** instead. In this case `C` must be
equal to `:modelDriven` (default), as a weighted data-driven solution is not defined.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> If passed as a matrix, `C` must be non-singular. No check is performed.
> 
> The columns of the leadfield matrix must be centered (common average reference).
> 
> A suitable regularization parameter `α`> 0 should be found by cross-validation or any other suitable method. Never assume an arbitrary value is suitable.

### sLORETA

```julia
function sLORETA(K::Matrix{R},
                 α::Real=0.,
                 C::Union{Symbol, Symmetric{R}, Hermitian{R}}=:modelDriven) where R<:Real
```

Given a n × 3p leadfield matrix, where n is the number of electrodes and 3p is the number of p voxels times 3 (the x, y, z source components),
return the **sLORETA transfer matrix** with regularization `α`.

if `C` is `:modelDriven` (default), compute the model driven solution, otherwise `C` must be the data covariance matrix and in this case compute the
data-driven solution, which is similar (actually better) to the linearly constrained minimum variance beamformer — see [here](https://github.com/Marco-Congedo/Loreta.jl/blob/master/Documents/Overview.pdf). If `C` is a matrix, it must be flagged as `Symmetric` or as `Hermitian`  — see the 💡 [examples](#-examples).

### eLORETA

```julia
function eLORETA(K::Matrix{R},
                 α::Real=0.,
                 C::Union{Symbol, Symmetric{R}, Hermitian{R}}=:modelDriven,
                 tol::Real=0.,
                 verbose=true) where R<:Real
```

Given a n × 3p leadfield matrix, where n is the number of electrodes and 3p is the number of p voxels times 3 (the x, y, z source components),
return the **eLORETA transfer matrix** with regularization `α`.

if `C` is `:modelDriven` (default), compute the model driven solution, otherwise `C` must be the data covariance matrix and in this case compute the
data-driven solution — see [here](https://github.com/Marco-Congedo/Loreta.jl/blob/master/Documents/Overview.pdf). If `C` is a matrix, it must be flagged as `Symmetric` or as `Hermitian`  — see the 💡 [examples](#-examples).

The model-driven solution is iterative; the convergence at each iteration is printed unless optional keyword argument `verbose` is set to false.

`tol` is the tolerance for establishing convergence; it defaults to the square root of `Base.eps` of the nearest type of the elements of `K`. This corresponds to requiring the average norm of the difference between the 3 × 3 diagonal blocks of the weight matrix in two successive iterations
to vanish for about half the significant digits.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> If passed as a matrix, `C` must be non-singular. No check is performed.
> 
> The columns of the leadfield matrix must be centered (common average reference).
>

## 💡 Examples

To use this package, all you will need is here below, where it is understood that you replace the example data matrix `X` and the leadfield matrix K with your own data and leadfield:

```julia
using Xloreta, LinearAlgebra

# example number of electrodes, data samples, voxels
n, s, p = 20, 200, 2000

# example random leadfield in common average reference
K = ℌ(n)*randn(n, 3p)

# example random EEG data
X=randn(s, n)

# random weights for weighted minimum norm solutions
weights=abs.(randn(3p))

# - - -

# sample covariance matrix of the random EEG data
C=Symmetric((1/s)*(X'*X))

Tmn1 = minNorm(K, 1)    # unweighted model-driven min norm with α=1
Tmn2 = minNorm(K, 10)   # unweighted model-driven min norm with α=10
Tmn3 = minNorm(K, 1; W=weights) # weighted model-driven min norm with α=1
Tmn4 = minNorm(K, 1, C) # data-driven min norm with α=1

TsLor1 = sLORETA(K, 1)     # model-driven sLORETA with α=1
TsLor2 = sLORETA(K, 10)    # model-driven sLORETA with α=10
TsLor3 = sLORETA(K, 1, C)  # data-driven sLORETA with α=1

TeLor1 = eLORETA(K, 1)     # model-driven eLORETA with α=1
TeLor2 = eLORETA(K, 10)    # model-driven eLORETA with α=10
TeLor3 = eLORETA(K, 1, C)  # data-driven eLORETA with α=1

# test the transfer matrix you creat
psfLocError(K, TeLor1) == 0 ? println("OK") : println("Error")
